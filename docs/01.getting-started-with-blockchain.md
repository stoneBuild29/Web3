### Blockchain

Blockchain is a distributed ledger constructed using a specialized data structure.Data is stored in blocks , with each block referencing the hash of the previous block, forming a chain-like structure. This design makes the system secure, efficient, decentralized and based on mutual consensus.

| Feature        | Traditional Economic Model | Blockchain             |
| :------------- | :------------------------: | :--------------------- |
| Control        |        Centralized        | Decentralized          |
| Trust          |       Intermediaries       | Cryptographic Proof    |
| Transparency   |          Limited          | Public or Pseudonymous |
| Intermediaries |          Required          | Eliminated             |
| Accessibility  |         Restricted         | Open to All            |
| Governance     |        Hierarchical        | Community-Driven       |
| Data Integrity |         Alterable         | Immutable              |

### Ethereum

Ethereum is a blockchain with an integrated Ethereum Virtual Machine(EVM), allowing developers to build decentralized applications(dApps) directly on the blockchain. It uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism where validators must stake ETH to propose and validate new blocks, ensuring network security and proper incentives.

> Supplement
>
> 1. Solidity: the primary programming language used for writting smart contracts on the EVM
> 2. Ether(ETH): the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum, used for transactions, staking, and paying gas fees

### Consensus

Blockchain consensus mechanisms, such as proof-of-work(PoW) and proof-of-stake(PoS), function like regulatory protocols. They ensure all nodes or partipants follow shared rules for validating transactions and achieving agreements on the network state.

> **Different Situations**
>
> * Blockchain: Bitcoin, built on Blockchain, relies on Proof-of-Work which depends on computational effort. Miners expend significant computational resources to solve cryptographic puzzles, adding blocks to the chain and maintaining network security.
> * Ethereum: Ethereum transtioned to Proof-of-Stake(PoS), which eliminates the need for energy-intensive energy. Instead, validators stake their ETH as collateral to propose and validate blocks. This mechanism ensures the network operates efficiently while reducing energy consumption.

> the difference on the consensus
>
> * PoW depends on computational power to validate transactions and secure the network.
> * PoS relies on the amount of cryptocurrency staked by validators, emphasizing economic incentives over raw computational resources.

> the principle
>
> When transactions occur, validators in Ethereum are selected to propose and validate blocks based on the amount of ETH staked, combined with a random selection mechanism. In constrast, Bitcoin miners solve a computational puzzle by adjusting the nonce in the block header to produce a hash that satisfies the network's difficulty target. The first miner to find a valid hash broadcasts the block to the network for validation and addition to the blockchain.

### DApp

Decentralized Applications (dApps) are programs deployed on peer-to-peer blockchain networks. When transactions meet the  conditions specified in a dApp's code, the application executes automatically.

> Components
>
> * Smart contract: the backend logic of the application, which runs autonomously.
> * Blockchain: deployment env
> * Tokens: A dApp's actions require "gas", which is paid for in the blockchain's native token.

> Characteristics
>
> * Security: less valuable to hacking and data breaches without a single point of failure
> * Decentralized: run on blockchain networks, eliminating the need for centralized control.
> * Consistency: the application executes the same functionality regardless of the environment.

> Category
>
> * DeFi: decentralized finance, like lending, staking and loaning
> * NFT: non-fungible tokens, Let's art.
> * Gaming
