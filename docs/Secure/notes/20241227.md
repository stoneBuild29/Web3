### **Goal**

* Gain a basic understanding of the project structure and technical skills required for deploying a smart contract using Hardhat.
* Resolve issues related to private keys and contract deployment.

### **Practical Method**

1. **Project Setup and Deployment** :

* Create a project using Hardhat.
* Deploy a basic smart contract using the created project.

  2.**Write a Simple Contract** :
* Write a simple ERC-721 contract for minting NFTs.

  3.**Debugging** :
* Troubleshoot and solve errors related to deployment inconsistencies (undefined return values).

### **Challenges**

1. **Spelling Mistakes in Code** :

* Identified and fixed minor issues such as incorrect function spelling, which affected contract execution.

2. **Private Key Issues** :

* Initially attempted to use a MetaMask private key, but the format did not match the required size.
* Realized that private keys need to start with "0x", and made adjustments to ensure correct format.
* Gained more understanding of the concept of gas fees and account balances.

3. **Return Value Issues** :

* Encountered an issue where the contract deployment result returned `undefined` in the terminal.
* Discovered that the core issue was related to the version of Ethers used.
* Resolved this by using the correct methods for fetching the contract address.
