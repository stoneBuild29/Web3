### Goal

know about the concept/function and understand the principle quickly

### Knowledge

1. Ethereum: a platform / apps
2. Ether: Ether is special because it is used to pay for the computation required to build and run apps and organizations on Ethereum.
3. Function: banking / gaming /  and etc
4. Who runs Ethereum?Ethereum is not controlled by any particular entity. It exists whenever there are connected computers running software following the Ethereum protocol and adding to the Ethereum blockchain. Each of these computers is known as a node. Practically, running a node needs hardware and software.
5. Smart contracts (a vending machine) are computer programs living on the Ethereum blockchain.(**how to revise some functions?**)
- given the same circumstances, the smart contract will produce the same result.
- stablecoin(Fiat backed / Crypto backed / Precious metals / Algorithmic)
  > Algorithmic
  > Imagine a token designed to track $1:
  > Scenario 1: Token price rises to $1.50.
  > The algorithm increases the supply, distributing more tokens to everyone proportionally. The higher supply lowers the scarcity, driving the price closer to $1.
  > Scenario 2: Token price falls to $0.80.
  > The algorithm decreases the supply by removing tokens from circulation. Reduced supply increases scarcity, driving the price closer to $1.

  (I don' know why so transactions are from Kekius?)

6. DEXs: Decentralized exchanges are open marketplaces for ETH and other tokens.
- Uniswap(**To be continued**)

- 1inch
- Bancor
- Kyber (I really know a little about DeFI !)
7. an Ethereum wallet
- Your wallet is a tool for interacting with your Ethereum account.
- Your wallet allows you to sign in to applications, read your balance, send transactions and verify your identity.
- method:
    - select a wallet 
    - create an account (a pair of keys)
    
8. Ethereum account

### Interesting Questions

1. Can I send bitcoin to an Ethereum address, or ether to a Bitcoin address?
    No, you cannot. Bitcoin and ether exist on two separate networks (i.e. different blockchains), each with their own bookkeeping and address formats.
2. If I own an ETH address, do I own the same address on other blockchains?
    You can use the same address on all blockchains that use similar underlying software to Ethereum (known as 'EVM-compatible').
3. What is Layer 2?  Wallets supporting Ethereum layer 2s **(?)**
4. Know more about Uniswap
