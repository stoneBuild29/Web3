# Goal

1. ~~learn the basic concept of blockchin,Ethereum and dapp~~
2. ~~know how to deal with transactions,the function of miners and Gas fee~~
3. grasp the Ethereum account model,transaction circuit and messaging
4. understand the basis grammer of Solidity(datatype,variable and control structure) and begin to code for a contract
5. learn a more complicated function(function,event and modifiers)
6. code and test the first simple smart contract

## Key

### Transaction

The Bitcoin transaction process ensures that transactiona are legimate, secure, and transparent. The following is a bitcoin transaction overview.

1.**Creating a Transaction**

When I want to send bitcoin, I would create a transaction from my digital wallet. The transaction includes my address (the public key of the sender), the recipent's address (public key), the amount of Bitcoin to be sent, and a transaction fee that I would pay for the miners.

2.**Digital Signature**

To prove that I am the owner of the bitcoin I want to send, the transaction must be signed using my private key through a cryptographic process.(Connecting with the essay I read above, I just realized that the difference and function of public key and private key. The private key is to authorizing the bitcoin previously just like my serect password. The public key is an address similarly to an email address.  It is derived mathematically from my private key and the process is irreversible.YES,It is ECDSA! )

3.**Broadcasting and confirmations**

Once signed, the transaction is broadcasted to the Bitcoin network and goes into the mempool, which is a temporary holding area for all unconfirmed transactions. **Miners** can pick transactions from the mempool to form new blocks. The first miner to solve a difficult mathematical problems gets to make the next block. The winning miner broadcasts its new block, which gets confirmed by the rest of the networl.

4.**Transaction Finalization**

Once confirmed, the new block is added to each network participant's copy of the blockchain. The transaction in the new block are considered to be confirmed.

### Miners

* Role:
  * Gather unconfirmed transactions from the menpool.
  * Solve the puzzle to create a new block.
  * Broadcast the new block to the network.
* Purpose:
  Secure the blockchain by:
  * Validating transactions.
  * Adding new blocks.
  * Preventing double-spending.
* Incentives:
  * Block Rewards:Newly minted bitcoins for mining a block.
  * Transaction Fees:Paid by users to prioritize their transactions.

> In my understanding, miners is not directly "digging up" any digital assets, but to get the rewards by computering labors with block and transaction fees.

> **Q&A
>
> `My question:If i dont calculate the puzzle and only validate the process ,would I get the award? The answer is NO! The role to validate the blocks in Bitcoin Network is NOdes(Validators). They ensure that 1. Transaction follow the consensus rules and the miner's solution to the puzzle is correct. So the validating process is a voluntary activity. `
>
> A: Around the network, there are four roles for participants: users, miners, validaters(nodes) and developers.

### Gas fee

Purpose: Incentive for miners/Network Congestion Management

> Example
>
> * **Transaction Size:** 250 bytes
> * **Fee Rate:** 20 sat/byte
> * **Fee Paid:** 250 bytes×20 sat/byte=5000 satoshis250
